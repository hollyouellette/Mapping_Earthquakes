# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to produce an interactive map that allows the web user the functionality to select and view the following:
  1. Earthquake data from that last 7 days 
  2. Showcase the location of the the Earth's tectonic plates.
  3. Isolate and see all of the earthquates with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
  
## Project Deliverables

[challenge_logic.js](https://github.com/hollyouellette/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/static/js/challenge_logic.js) located in [static/js](https://github.com/hollyouellette/Mapping_Earthquakes/tree/main/Earthquake_Challenge/static/js) contains the following completed deliverables:

   **Deliverable 1:** When [index.html](https://github.com/hollyouellette/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/Earthquake_Challenge/index.html) is opened, the user is able to view both the earthquake data and tectonic plate data.
  
   **Deliverable 2:** Major earthquake data was loaded as a third layer group so that the user can easily view all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.
 
 **Deliverable 3:** A third map tile is created and added as an overlay object as an additional viewing option to the user.
